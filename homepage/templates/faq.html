                    <h2>I am having trouble installing Orange.</h2>
                    <p>Make sure you are downloading the latest version. You can also try to download a standalone installer or Anaconda distribution.</p>
                    <p>Still no luck? Check our <a href="https://github.com/biolab/orange3/issues">issue tracker</a> for similar issues or report a new one.</p>

                    <h2>I am having trouble installing an add-on.</h2>
                    <p>Make sure you are using the latest version of Orange. Alternatively, you can try with Anaconda distribution and install the add-on in the terminal. You can use pip or conda to install a package directly. E.g.:
                    <pre>pip install orange3-text<br>conda install orange3-timeseries</pre></p>

                    <h2>I get an error when using Orange.</h2>

If this doesn’t fix the issue, you should be able to see an error window pop up, prompting you to submit the issue to the developers.

                    <h2>I would like to learn how to use Orange. Where can I find the resources?</h2>
                    <p>Widget documentation available on our <a href="https://orange.biolab.si/toolbox/">website</a>. We also provide an e-mail course (<a href="https://biolab.us15.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=2cad1f1cbf3a532a77efe4354&id=6f257f15ff">subscribe here</a>), beginner-level <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmNPvQr9Tf-ZSDLwOzxpvY-HrE0yv-8Fy">YouTube tutorials</a> and a regularly updated <a href="https://blog.biolab.si/">blog</a>.</p>

                    <h2>I have a question concerning data mining, statistics and machine learning algorithms.</h2>
                    <p>Visit <a href="https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/orange">Data Science StackExchange</a> and ask the community!</p>

                    <h2>What data does Orange support?</h2>
                    <p>Core Orange supports Excel, comma- and tab-delimited files (.xlsx, .csv, .tab). It also reads online data, such as Google Spreadsheets. Orange3-ImageAnalytics add-on can import images (.jpg, .tiff, .png). Orange3-Corpus add-on can import text files (.txt, .docx, .odt). SQL widget supports Postgres and MySQL databases.</p>

                    <h2>I want to use Orange on big data.</h2>
                    <p>Orange provides SQL widget, which samples data instances and enables exploratory data analysis on large datasets. You need <a href="http://initd.org/psycopg/">psycopg2</a> module installed to be able to see the widget. Install it directly in Python with <code>pip install psycopg</code> command. You can also use <a href="https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/resources/2uda/">2UDA package</a> for easier installation. Please note that Orange supports only Postgres and MySQL databases for now.</p>

                    <h2>Can I export Orange workflow as a Python script?</h2>
                    <p>Unfortunately, no. We've debated this long and hard and it is simply not possible to maintain interactive analysis and export the workflow as a Python script at the same time. And interactive visualizations and exploratory data analysis are the very heart of Orange.</p>

                    <h2>I wish to propose a collaboration and/or a project with Orange team.</h2>
                    <p>Please submit a contact request and we will respond as soon as we can.</p>

                    <h2>I wish to develop a widget / an add-on for Orange.</h2>
